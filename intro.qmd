## Motivation

During my last few years as early career scientist in hydrogeology, I noticed something, that has been studied and written about a lot already: Reproducibility! Reproducibility in science! And there are even concepts and tools for adressing this issue and to ensure a high level of reproducibility in science since the early days of computers and programming.

The text above says 'at first I was like...' The lower cartoon is a friendly, smiling R-logo jumping up to give a happy fuzzy monster a high-five under a smiling sun and next to colorful flowers. The text above the bottom illustration reads 'but now it's like...'"}

## Readership (who is this for?)

This course or book is meant for anybody

-   interested in learning essential **tools for data science**
-   interested in state-of-the-art methods for **reproducibility in science**
-   **with or without** prior knowledge of programming in general or R (although it wouldn't hurt of course)

## About Me

I am working as a researcher in the field of machine learning and hydrogeology at the Federal Institute for Geoscience and Natural Resources (BGR). My projects include modelling groundwater quality parameters for producing maps as well as modelling groundwater level time series for making predictions. For this purpose I startet learning R mainly and a little bit Python a few years ago. Besides this, I enjoy using R for making data visualizations and teaching R and its capabilities to others.
