    "text": "Content\nWelcome to Applied R Programming for Geoscience — From Data Cleaning to Publishing! This online book contains the material for the corresponding R teaching course. The content of this course focusses on showing the capabilities of programming languages (in this cas R) for every task throughout most common in research project workflows: starting with\n\ndata import, cleaning and wrangling,\nanalysis,\nhigh quality visualizations to\nwriting manuscripts for peer-reviewed journal publishing.\n\nall done in one single free open-source environment. Due to the contrained time, this course is not meant to be a comprehensive programming with R introductory course and therefore, will not go into details of each of the mentioned steps. It will rather show that all this can be done in R. I hope that seeing the advantages of it will encourage all participants to further keep learning programming and applying all the useful tools that come with it. As compensation, this book provides hints to online resources that help to get a foot into the door of improving R programming skills."
