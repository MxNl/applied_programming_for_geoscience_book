# Visualizations

This is a very helpful tool for finding out the best suited chart type for a data visualization of a given data structure:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Link to Website: [https://www.data-to-viz.com/](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.data-to-viz.com/")
```
