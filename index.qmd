## Content {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Applied R Programming for Geoscience --- From Data Cleaning to Publishing*! This online book contains the material for the corresponding R teaching course. The content of this course focusses on showing the capabilities of programming languages (in this cas R) for every task throughout most common in research project workflows: starting with

-   data import, cleaning and wrangling,
-   analysis,
-   high quality visualizations to
-   writing manuscripts for peer-reviewed journal publishing.

all done in a single free and open-source environment. Due to the constrained time, this course is not meant to be a comprehensive programming with R introductory course and therefore, will not go into details of each of the mentioned steps. It will rather show that all this can be done in R. I hope that seeing the advantages of it will encourage all participants to further keep learning programming and applying all the useful tools that come with it. As compensation, this book provides hints to online resources that help to get a foot into the door of improving R programming skills.
