    "text": "Content\nWelcome to Applied R Programming for Geoscience — From Data Cleaning to Publishing! This online book contains the material for the corresponding R teaching course. The content of this course focusses on showing the capabilities of programming languages (in this cas R) for every task throughout most common in research project workflows: starting with\n\ndata import, cleaning and wrangling,\nanalysis,\nhigh quality visualizations to\nwriting manuscripts for peer-reviewed journal publishing.\n\nall done in one single free open-source environment. Due to the contrained time, this course is not meant to be a comprehensive programming with R introductory course and therefore, will not go into details of each of the mentioned steps. It will rather show that all this can be done in R. I hope that seeing the advantages of it will encourage all participants to further keep learning programming and applying all the useful tools that come with it. As compensation, this book provides hints to online resources that help to get a foot into the door of improving R programming skills."

Reproducibility in science! And there are even concepts and tools for adressing this issue and to ensure a high level of reproducibility in science since the early days of computers and programming."

My projects include modelling groundwater quality parameters for producing maps as well as modelling groundwater level time series for making predictions. For this purpose I startet learning R mainly and a little bit Python a few years ago. Besides this, I enjoy using R for making data visualizations and teaching R and its capabilities to others."

There are many great places in the internet where you can find smaller and bigger data science challenges and projects. I really recommend to visit those places and just learn by directly solving tasks. Most important ones are:\n\nKaggle\nTidyTuesday\nAdventOfCode\n30DayMapChallenge\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Community\nThe R community is very friendly and supportive community. Most important packages have great documentations for learning new R packages and frameworks. The R community has an extraordinary sense of sharing knowledge and experiences. Important platforms for getting engaged with the R community but also for getting help with questions, issues and bugs are\n\nStackoverflow for getting help with questions\nPosit community forum (formerly Rstudio) for getting help with questions\nTwitter with #rstats for keeping track of latest developments, tips, tricks and getting in touch with the active R community members\nMastodon with #rstats, same same\nGithub for getting help with bugs, getting to know the developers behind packages or simply hosting and versioning your own code"
