### Learning R --- through Challenges and small Projects

For speeding up the learning process it is more important to practise rather than reading books. There are many great places in the internet where you can find smaller and bigger data science challenges and projects. I really recommend to visit those places and just learn by directly solving tasks. Most important ones are:

-   Kaggle

-   TidyTuesday

-   AdventOfCode

-   [30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/)

### Community

The R community is very friendly and supportive community. Most important packages have great documentations for learning new R packages and frameworks. The R community has an extraordinary sense of sharing knowledge and experiences. Important platforms for getting engaged with the R community but also for getting help with questions, issues and bugs are

-   [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) for getting help with questions

-   [Posit community forum (formerly Rstudio)](https://community.rstudio.com/) for getting help with questions

-   [Twitter with #rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query) for keeping track of latest developments, tips, tricks and getting in touch with the active R community members

-   [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) with #rstats, same same

-   [Github](https://github.com/) for getting help with bugs, getting to know the developers behind packages or simply hosting and versioning your own code
